1. What are the key differences between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN in SQL?
INNER JOIN returns only records with matching values in both tables.

OUTER JOIN includes all records from one or both tables and fills in NULLs where there's no match.

LEFT OUTER JOIN: All from left + matching from right

RIGHT OUTER JOIN: All from right + matching from left

FULL OUTER JOIN: All from both, with NULLs for unmatched sides

2. How do you handle missing data in a dataset?
Identify missing values using isnull() (Python) or IS NULL (SQL)

Decide based on context:

Drop rows/columns if data is not significant

Impute with mean, median, or mode

Use predictive models (like KNN)

Flag missing data as a separate category if meaningful

3. What is the difference between variance and standard deviation?
Variance is the average of squared differences from the mean.

Standard deviation is the square root of variance—provides a scale closer to the data.

4. Explain the concept of normalization in databases.
Normalization structures a database to reduce redundancy and dependency.

It involves organizing data into multiple related tables.

It improves data integrity and efficiency (1NF → 5NF).

5. What is the role of a primary key in a relational database?
A primary key uniquely identifies each record.

It ensures no duplicates and helps create relationships between tables via foreign keys.

6. How would you detect outliers in a dataset?
Use statistical methods like:

Z-Score: if > 3 or < -3

IQR method: values outside 1.5 * IQR

Visualization: boxplots, scatter plots

Model-based detection (e.g., Isolation Forest)

7. What is data wrangling and why is it important?
Data wrangling is the process of cleaning, enriching, and transforming raw data into a usable format.

It ensures consistency, completeness, and readiness for analysis or modeling.

8. Describe a situation where you used data to solve a business problem.

16. What are the common KPIs used in business analysis?
Revenue, Profit Margin, Conversion Rate, CAC, Churn Rate, ROI, NPS, Average Order Value.

17. What is A/B testing and how is it used in data analysis?
A/B testing compares two variants (control vs test).

Measures impact of changes (e.g., design, pricing) using statistical testing.

18. How do you ensure data accuracy and integrity in a project?
Apply data validation rules

Use constraints (e.g., primary/foreign keys)

Regularly audit, clean, and test against source data

19. What is a correlation matrix and how do you interpret it?
A matrix showing pairwise correlation coefficients.

Values close to 1 or -1 indicate strong positive or negative correlation.

20. What is the difference between correlation and causation?
Correlation: two variables move together

Causation: one variable directly affects the other

Correlation ≠ causation

21. Describe a data project where you used Python.
Built a CO₂ emissions dashboard

Used pandas for preprocessing and matplotlib for sector trends

Forecasted emissions with ARIMA

22. What libraries do you use for data analysis in Python?
pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Plotly, statsmodels

23. Explain the use of Pandas groupby() function.
Groups data by key columns to apply aggregation functions like sum, mean, or count.

24. How do you deal with imbalanced datasets?
Use resampling (SMOTE, oversampling)

Adjust class weights

Use evaluation metrics like ROC-AUC or F1-score

25. What are the steps of a typical data analysis pipeline?
Define the problem

Collect data

Clean & prepare data

Explore & analyze

Model (optional)

26. What is the purpose of data visualization?
To communicate insights clearly and drive informed decision-making.

27. Explain the difference between ETL and ELT.
ETL: Extract → Transform → Load (used in on-prem systems)

ELT: Extract → Load → Transform (used in cloud data warehouses)

28. What is the difference between OLAP and OLTP systems?
OLAP: Read-heavy, used for analysis (e.g., BI dashboards)

OLTP: Write-heavy, used for real-time transactions (e.g., e-commerce)

29. How do you decide which chart to use for a dataset?
Based on data type:

Time → line chart

Categories → bar chart

Distribution → histogram

Relationships → scatter plot
